# Simple-ML-project-on-the-titanic-dataset

This project is my shot at the titanic survival competition. This notebook features an end to end machine learning project from data analysis to parameters tunning. 

1. Dataset inspection: Getting to know the data 
2. Cleaning the data
3. Feature engineering
4. Data exploration
5. Model selection
6. Parameters tunning


All feedbacks are welcome.
